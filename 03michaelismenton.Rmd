  michaelis-menton kinetics
========================================================
Michaelis-Menton kinetics represent an enzymatic reaction that involves competitive inhibition. An inhibitor binds to an enzme to form an inhibitor enzyme complex such that the enzyme cannot catalyze some other desired reaction.
The typical application is the determination of the rate in the presence of an inhibitor concentration 
contrasted to the rate at a different inhibitor concentration.


#E + S <-> ES

x <- seq(0,10,by=0.1)

curve(2*x/(1+x))

micmen <- function(x,a=2,b=1){
  a*x/(b+x)
}

curve(micmen(x), from=0, to=8, ylim=c(0,4))
